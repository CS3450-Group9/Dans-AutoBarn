# Car Rental Project
## Project Overview
This project aims to build a system for running a Car rental operation.  The car rental operation will function as the whole system for the entire brick and mortar operation.  The Car Rental System will be designed to provide a view for a cashier, a view for a customer and  a view for a manager.  The car rental system will provide a few more back end features, the ability to breakdown a car, a car tracking system, and a system to track car availability among other things.  
## Team Organization
We will be using agile development techniques, rotating through scrum masters as the project progresses.  The goal is to keep the team organization as simple as possible.  Tasks will be assigned during standup and everyone is given the equal tasks determined by the hours estimate agreed upon. 
## Software Development Process
The development will be broken up into five phases.  Specifically, each phase will be like a Sprint, in that work to be done will be organized into small tasks, placed into a “backlog”, and prioritized.  Then, using time-box scheduling, the team will decide which tasks the phase (Sprint) will address.  The team will use a Scrum Board to keep track of tasks in the backlog, those that will be part of the current Sprint, those in progress, and those that are done.  

Each phase will also be a little like an iteration in a Spiral process, in that each phase will include some risk analysis and that any development activity (requirements capture, analysis, design, implementation, etc.) can be done during any phase.  Early phases will focus on understanding (requirements capture and analysis) and subsequent phases will focus on design and implementation.  Each phase will include a retrospective.  

Phase - Iteration  
1 - Requirements Capture  
2 - Analysis, Architectural, UI, and DB Design  
3 - Implementation, and Unit Testing  
4 - More Implementation and Testing   

We will use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to document user goals, structural concepts, component interactions, and behaviors.
## Communication policies, procedures, and tools
Communication will be done via discord. Scrum meetings will be either over calls or in person in class. We will have Jira to organize tasks and use github for collaboration. The procedures for version control of Github can be found in the README for the project.
## Configuration Management
See the README.md in the Git repository.
